# BHOS - Lab 1/2 exercises

To test your solutions you need to install Nodejs.

- `cd` to project directory.
- Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
- Run `npm test` run tests.

When your task is completed send it to `orkhan.huseyn@outlook.com` with following subject:

```
BHOS_{group_name}_{full_name}_lab1
```

Example: `BHOS_21.1_Filankes_Filankesov_lab1`. If your emails subject does not match the described pattern, it's like you've never sent me the solution. So follow the pattern.

As the contents of the email, include either the GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket repository link to the solutions or zip file that contains your solutions (NOT RAR).
